Dungeons & Dragons is a text-based, open world game with an adventurous storyline and a thrilling gameplay.
From the thrills to sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak; embark on an action-packed adventure in worlds of swords and sorcery.Delve into an immersive experience as you explore the mysterious little town of Kaza, full of various elements of surprise.

## Explore the Town of Kaza
Forged on the Northern side of Kingdom Vanaheim, on the banks of river Sipu and surrounded by Clove Mountains on the west,the hamlet of Kaza is home to a polulation of around 200 people, led by King Victor. With its settlements of galvanised steel rooftops, decaying walls and foggy surroundings, Kaza has a desolate atmosphere. The main attraction is the Ding Dong Tower, which was built 55 years ago and designed by wood elves. 

Kaza has an advancing economy, which is mainly supported by alchemy, fishing and crafting. But their biggest strengths are highly skilled thieving and rare wood production. In the swinging sixties, when casinos opened in Kaza, people were convinced that
they had found the ideal way of earning a living without actually having to do any work. 
        
On one side of the town, everything is lush and beautiful- and there are virtually no prey. On the other side of the town, on the top of Clove Mountains, everything is scorched. Dragons have anhilitated much of the other species.
Kaza lacks people skilled in war. The king's men have been trying to reach the capital of the Kingdom for centuries, but they cannot cross the mountains, as their skin would melt under the heat of the powerful and mighty Dragons. This, once beautiful place is beginning to fall apart due to pack wars. Someone needs to end this.
